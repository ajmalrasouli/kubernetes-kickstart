# Module 2: Setting Up Your Local Lab

Theory is important, but Kubernetes is best learned by doing. In this module, we will bridge the gap from concept to practice by setting up your very own Kubernetes cluster right on your personal computer.

This local cluster will be a safe and isolated sandbox where you can experiment, deploy applications, and follow along with the exercises in later modules without any cost or risk.

## Key Topics Covered

*   **What is a Local Cluster?**: Understanding the purpose and benefits of running Kubernetes on your own machine for learning and development.
*   **Introduction to Minikube**: We'll introduce Minikube, a popular and easy-to-use tool for creating single-node Kubernetes clusters.
*   **Installation and Verification**: A step-by-step guide to installing Minikube and verifying that your local Kubernetes cluster is up and running.

By the end of this module, you will have a fully functional Kubernetes environment and the basic commands to manage it. Let's get building!
