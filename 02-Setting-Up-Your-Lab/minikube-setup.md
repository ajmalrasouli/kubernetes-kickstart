# Step-by-Step Guide: Setting Up a Lab with Minikube

## What is Minikube?

Minikube is a tool that makes it easy to run a single-node Kubernetes cluster on your local machine (like a laptop or desktop). It's perfect for beginners, developers, and anyone who wants to try out Kubernetes without needing access to a large cloud provider. Minikube runs all the core Kubernetes components inside a single virtual machine or container on your computer.

## Prerequisites

Before we start, you'll need two things:

1.  **A decent computer**: At least 2 CPUs, 2GB of RAM, and 20GB of free disk space.
2.  **A container or virtual machine manager**: Minikube needs a driver to create the node. The most common and recommended choice is **Docker**. If you don't have it, please install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) for your operating system first.

## Step 1: Install Minikube

The installation process varies slightly for each operating system.

### macOS

The easiest way to install Minikube on macOS is with the [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) package manager.

```bash
# This command will download and install the latest version of minikube
brew install minikube
