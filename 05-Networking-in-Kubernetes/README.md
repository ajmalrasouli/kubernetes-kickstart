# Module 5: Networking in Kubernetes

So far, you've successfully deployed an application and learned how to manage its configuration. But how do different parts of your application talk to each other? How do users from the outside world access your service? And how do you secure that communication?

Welcome to the networking module! In this section, you'll explore the fundamental networking concepts that make communication possible and secure in a Kubernetes cluster. We will revisit Services in more detail and introduce two powerful new objects: Ingress and Network Policies.

## Key Topics Covered

*   **A Deep Dive into Services**: We'll explore the different types of Services (`ClusterIP`, `NodePort`, and `LoadBalancer`) and understand the specific use case for each one.
*   **Ingress: The API Gateway**: Learn how to use an Ingress to manage external access to multiple services in your cluster, routing traffic based on hostnames or paths. This is the standard way to expose web applications in production.
*   **Network Policies: A Firewall for Your Pods**: Discover how to use Network Policies to control the flow of traffic between Pods, creating a more secure, "zero-trust" environment within your cluster.

Understanding these concepts is essential for building robust, scalable, and secure applications on Kubernetes.05-Networking-in-Kubernetes/README.md
